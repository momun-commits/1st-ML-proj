Solubility Prediction using Machine Learning

📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a simple machine learning workflow to predict the aqueous solubility of chemical compounds (logS values) based on molecular descriptors.

The dataset used is the Delaney solubility dataset, which contains chemical descriptors and experimental solubility values.

📂 Dataset

Source: Delaney Solubility Dataset

Target Variable: logS (aqueous solubility)

Features: Molecular descriptors (various numerical columns)

⚙️ Steps in the Notebook

Load Dataset using pandas.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data distribution.

Feature & Target Separation:

X → Molecular descriptors

y → Solubility (logS)

Model Building (Regression models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)

Model Evaluation using metrics such as RMSE, R² score.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

Pandas, NumPy (Data Handling)

Scikit-learn (Model Training & Evaluation)

Matplotlib / Seaborn (Visualization)

📈 Results

The trained regression model is able to predict solubility values with reasonable accuracy.

Metrics (RMSE, R²) show how well the model generalizes on unseen data.
